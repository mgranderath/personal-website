This is a small tutorial on how to get started with a React, TypeScript and Styled Components project.

<!-- end -->

## Setting up

First we have to install `create-react-app` in case you don't have it installed:

```console
npm install -g create-react-app
```

and then we can get started by running `create-react-app` to generate the standard React + TypeScript boilerplate for us:

```console
npx create-react-app <name_of_project> --typescript
```

## Boilerplate

Inside the project's `src` folder we have the generated React code but without `styled-components`.
